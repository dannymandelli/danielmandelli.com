        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li>Designed an automated system in Python to control stepper motors and collect light measurements at predetermined angular increments.</li>
          <li>All results are compiled and easily accessible to end user.</li>
          <li>Built and interfaced the system with a GUI written in C# on the .NET Framework.</li>
          <li>Established connection with an SQLite database to communicate between the GUI and Python script.</li>
